# Dynamic Tensegrity Optimization and Analysis

Tensegrity Structures are systems composed of rigid members and strings that are held together by compression and tension.Tensegrity structures can be used for a variety of real-world applications that range from energy absorbtion and dissapation to intelligent deformation based off of changing loads.

This repository explores a method of optimization of tensegrity lattices based on their energy absobption characteristics for applications in spacecraft landing mechanisms.

This research is being conducted out of the morphing lab under Prof. Edwin A. P. Hernandez
