# Dynamic Tensegrity Optimization and Analysis

Tensegrity Structures are systems composed of rigid members and strings that are held together by compression and tension.Tensegrity structures can be used for a variety of real-world applications that range from energy absorbtion and dissapation to intelligent deformation based off of changing loads.

This repository explores a method of optimization of tensegrity lattices based on their energy absobption characteristics for applications in spacecraft landing mechanisms.
